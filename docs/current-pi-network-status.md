- [ ] Check pi-nodejs for backend integration
- [ ] Look for recent changes or deprecations

### Task 3: Check Official Announcements
- [ ] Review recent Pi Network blog posts
- [ ] Check for sandbox/testnet announcements
- [ ] Look for deprecation notices
- [ ] Verify current development practices

### Task 4: Community Research

- [ ] Review common development issues
- [ ] Check for workarounds or alternatives

## Expected Outcomes

### If Sandbox/Testnet Still Available
- Document current endpoints and configuration
- Update integration guide with current practices
- Provide setup instructions for current environment

### If Sandbox/Testnet Deprecated
- Document current development approach
- Update integration strategy
- Provide alternative testing methods

### If Information Unclear
- Document current uncertainty
- Provide best practices based on available information
- Suggest alternative approaches for development

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Research current developer portal and documentation
2. **Short-term**: Update integration guide based on findings
3. **Long-term**: Establish current best practices for Pi Network development

## Initial Research Findings

### NPM Package Analysis (2025-01-18)

#### Official Pi Network Packages
1. **pi-backend** (v0.1.3)
   - **Status**: Official Pi Network Node.js package
   - **Last Updated**: Over a year ago (2023-02-03)
   - **Maintainer**: aurelien-pi (official Pi Network team)
   - **Dependencies**: axios, stellar-sdk
   - **Note**: This appears to be the official backend SDK but hasn't been updated recently

2. **@pi-apps/pi-nodejs** (Not Found)
   - **Status**: Package not found in npm registry
   - **Note**: The GitHub repository exists but no npm package is published

#### Community Packages
1. **@0205miss/pi_net_sdk** (v2.0.2)
   - **Status**: Community-maintained Pi Network SDK
   - **Last Updated**: Recent (2025-06-06)
   - **Maintainer**: 0205miss (community developer)
   - **Dependencies**: axios
   - **Note**: This is a community package, not official

2. **pi-stream-sdk** (v1.1.6)
   - **Status**: Community package for Stellar muxed accounts
   - **Last Updated**: Recent (2025-07-17)
   - **Maintainer**: soleil00 (community developer)
   - **Note**: Focused on Stellar integration, not Pi Network specific

3. **pi-network-browser-detect** (v1.0.5)
   - **Status**: Community package for Pi Browser detection
   - **Last Updated**: Recent (2025-06-08)
   - **Maintainer**: crossabc (community developer)
   - **Note**: Utility package for detecting Pi Browser environment

### Key Observations

1. **Official SDK Status**: The official `pi-backend` package hasn't been updated in over a year, suggesting possible deprecation or shift in development approach.

2. **Community Activity**: There are active community packages being maintained, indicating ongoing developer interest but lack of official updates.

3. **Package Gap**: The absence of `@pi-apps/pi-nodejs` in npm suggests the official Node.js SDK may not be actively maintained or published.

4. **Development Approach**: The presence of `pi-network-browser-detect` suggests the current approach focuses on Pi Browser detection rather than standalone SDK usage.

### Implications for Our Project

1. **Current Approach is Correct**: Our current approach of using mock data for development and real Pi SDK only in Pi Browser appears to align with current practices.

2. **No Official Sandbox**: The lack of recent official SDK updates suggests there may not be an official sandbox environment available.

3. **Community Alternatives**: While community packages exist, they may not be officially supported or maintained.

4. **Focus on Pi Browser**: The emphasis on Pi Browser detection suggests that real Pi Network integration is primarily intended for use within the Pi Browser environment.

### Next Research Steps

1. **Check GitHub Repositories**: Verify the current state of official Pi Network repositories
2. **Review Developer Portal**: Check current documentation and setup instructions
3. **Community Research**: Look for recent discussions about sandbox/testnet availability
4. **Update Integration Strategy**: Based on findings, update our integration approach

### Preliminary Recommendations

Based on initial findings, our current approach appears to be correct:

1. **Development**: Use mock data and Pi Browser detection
2. **Testing**: Test real integration only in Pi Browser
3. **Production**: Use real Pi Network SDK only in Pi Browser environment
4. **Documentation**: Update to reflect current state of Pi Network development tools
